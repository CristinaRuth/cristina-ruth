# Then and Now

## 6 years ago
* I would rather code all day than to talk with people.
* I focused on myself and only worked people if I had to.
* I pretended I was busy with my phone or something else when I find myself in an elevator with a stranger.
* I clammed up when speaking in front of a lot of people.

## Today
* I actually **like** talking to people. In fact, I start feeling sad if I spend too many days coding by myself.
* I focused on others and continually sought out new people even if I don't have to work with them.
* I say hi and chat about the weather, or what's currently happening, with a stranger in an elevator. I also smile and say hi to people I "meet" in the hallways.
* I can talk comfortably in front of a lot of people. I still get nervous, but it's way easier now.

# What Happened?

The first couple of years, I think it was mainly due to increased job responsibilities -- becoming more of a lead/senior dev. As part of that, I had to interact and talk with people a *lot* more. I had to clarify requirements, ask questions, set expectations, coordinate with testers, etc. 

Over the years, I learned to "banter" and "small talk" through trials and errors and practice -- *lots* of practice.

Then, a few years ago, I read a couple of books (mentioned below) that radically changed my view from *me* to *you* -- and **genuinely** caring for others, their needs and listening.

It was hard but after reading those books, I actively **tried** doing things that I was super uncomfortable about -- like...
* Saying hi to complete strangers
* Speaking in front of people
* Making small talk
* Finding topics to talk about, and
* Keeping conversations going

There were a LOT of cringy and mortifying moments like...

> OMG. That did NOT go well. So embarrassing!

But despite those, I still kept on trying. And trying. And trying. And telling myself:

> OK. That was not good, but let's focus on what YOU can learn from this and learn what NOT to do next so we can improve!

And somehow, suddenly, I realized that I can talk with people better and I can talk in front of people better. It's *easier*! Note the *er*. It's still hard, but it's not as gut-wrenching as I found it before.

1. Became a meetup organizer. It gave me practice speaking in front of people.
1. Submitted and presented talks for conferences.
1. Actively engaged in a “hi how are you?” conversations with strangers despite it being sooo nerve wracking!


All of the above were so terrifying but I didn’t let that stop me. I did it anyway and I celebrated the simple fact that I did it. And if it went wrong, I focused on the fact that I did it and what I could do better next time. And then I did it again. And again. And again.

Just gotta keep trying and you’ll eventually realize that “oh wow. I’ve gotten better at this.”
