On Growth
6 years ago, this was me. I would rather code all day than to talk with people.

Then, as my job responsibilities increased, I had to talk with people more. Clarify requirements, ask questions, set expectations, coordinate with testers, etc.

I remember getting really really nervous right before getting up and talking in front of a bunch of people.

I remember at conference breakfast/lunches, **ensuring** I sat at tables with people I already knew.

Today:

* I actually **like** talking to people. In fact, I get down if I spend too many days coding by myself.
* I still get nervous right before talking in front of people but I’m way less nervous and I feel comfortable in the spotlight.
* At conferences, I **purposely** sit at tables where I do not know people.

How? I think it’s just being aware, actively trying and keeping on trying even though it’s uncomfortable, being kind to myself if things go wrong, and celebrating my small wins.

Some of the things I did:

Became a meetup organizer. It gave me practice speaking in front of people.
Submitted and presented talks for conferences.
Actively engaged in a “hi how are you?” conversations with strangers despite it being sooo nerve wracking!
All of the above were so terrifying but I didn’t let that stop me. I did it anyway and I celebrated the simple fact that I did it. And if it went wrong, I focused on the fact that I did it and what I could do better next time. And then I did it again. And again. And again.

Just gotta keep trying and you’ll eventually realize that “oh wow. I’ve gotten better at this.”
