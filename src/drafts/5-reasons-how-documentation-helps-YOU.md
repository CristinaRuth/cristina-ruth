# 5 Ways Writing Documentation Helps YOU

When I first started my professional dev career, I **hated** writing documentation. I didn't think it was as fun as coding and so, I never took the time to write them.

Over the years, as my job responsibilities progressed, I realized how valuable writing documentation is and that, ultimately, doing so helps **me**.

In this article, we'll walk through 5 ways writing documentation helps **you**:

1. Help yourself in the future.

1. Help your teammates.

1. Free your time.

1. Help yourself stand out.

## 1. Help Yourself in the future
That code you write and how it all works together, as well as all the business logic around it and how everything is connected -- that *context* **WILL** be gone in just a few weeks of not working on it.

When you have multiple codebases to touch or large codebases with multiple various complex functionalities, each piece will have *pick-up time*.

## 2. Help Your Teammates
