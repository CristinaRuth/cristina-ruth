# 5 Ways Writing Documentation Helps YOU

When I first started my professional dev career, I **hated** writing documentation. I didn't think it was as fun as coding and so, I never took the time to write them.

Over the years, as my job responsibilities progressed, I realized how valuable writing documentation is and that, ultimately, doing so helps **me**.

## What is Documentation?

Before we go any further, let's first clarify what documentation is.

> Documentation is written "articles" or descriptions around a specific topic.

Documentation can be written for many things like:

* Explaining the description of classes, functions and variables.

* Explaining the "why" behind business logic.

* Explaining how things in a system connect together. (i.e. diagrams of database connections and APIs and servers, etc)

* Explaining how to get something set up. (i.e. getting a developer machine setup to enable development work for a given repository)

* Explaining guidelines. (i.e. a standards documentation around variable naming and patterns to be used)

* Explaining troubleshooting steps for common problems.

* Explaining the high-level logic flow of a specific feature. (i.e. diagram flowchart)

As developers, we read documentation when:

* Trying to install a "plugin" into our project. We then read through their "get started" documentation.

* Trying to troubleshoot a bug, and we find our way into a "plugin". We then read through their "troubleshooting" documentation.

* When we're looking into contributing to an open soruce project, we read through their "Contributing.md" documentation.

* When we're setting up our machines to have a local working environment for an open source project, we read through their "Setup.md" documentation.


## How Documentation Helps YOU

In this article, we'll walk through 5 ways writing documentation helps **you**:

1. Help yourself in the future.

1. Help your teammates.

1. Free your time.

1. Help yourself stand out.

## 1. Help Yourself in the future
That code you write and how it all works together, as well as all the business logic around it and how everything is connected -- that *context* **WILL** be gone in just a few weeks of not working on it.

When you have multiple codebases to touch or large codebases with multiple various complex functionalities, each piece will have *pick-up time* which will take a **lot longer** without documentation.

## 2. Help Your Teammates

## 3. Free Your time

## 4. Help Yourself Stand Out
