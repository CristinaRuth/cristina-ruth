# 5 Steps to Become a Web Developer
# 1. Understand Front-End vs Back-End

Web developers bring websites to life. A more complicated website would need a **front-end** and a **back-end**.

* **Front-end** typically deals with whatever the user sees on the website, and handles anything the user *does* on the site. Some examples are:
    * *Button clicks.* On YouTube, if the user clicks on the "hamburger" menu on the left, the left menu toggles between wide and narrow.
    * *Mouse hovers.* On YouTube, if a user's mouse hovers over a video thumbnail, it becomes animated to show a preview of the video.
* **Back-end** deals with information retrieval/storage and any logic that needs to be applied depending on the information that it handles. Some examples are:

# 2. Choose Your Track

Now that you understand what **front-end** vs **back-end** is, now you can choose a track of which one to focus on.

You could be:
1. **A front-end developer.** You would focus on the *client* side, as described above. 
1. **A back-end developer.** You would focus on the backend
1. **A full-stack developer.**

# 3. Choose Your Technologies
