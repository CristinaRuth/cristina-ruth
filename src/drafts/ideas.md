# On Growth

6 years ago, this was me. I would rather code all day than to talk with people.

Then, as my job responsibilities increased, I had to talk with people more. Clarify requirements, ask questions, set expectations, coordinate with testers, etc.

I remember getting really really nervous right before getting up and talking in front of a bunch of people.

I remember at conference breakfast/lunches,  **ensuring** I sat at tables with people I already knew.

Today:
* I actually **like** talking to people. In fact, I get down if I spend too many days coding by myself.
* I still get nervous right before talking in front of people but I‚Äôm way less nervous and I  feel comfortable in the spotlight.
* At conferences, I **purposely** sit at tables where I do not know people.

How? I think it‚Äôs just being aware, actively trying and keeping on trying even though it‚Äôs uncomfortable, being kind to myself if things go wrong, and celebrating my small wins.

Some of the things I did:
* Became a meetup organizer. It gave me practice speaking in front of people.
* Submitted and presented talks for conferences.
* Actively engaged in a ‚Äúhi how are you?‚Äù conversations with strangers despite it being sooo nerve wracking!

All of the above were so terrifying but I didn‚Äôt let that stop me. I did it anyway and I celebrated the simple fact that I did it. And if it went wrong, I focused on the fact that I did it and what I could do better next time. And then I did it again. And again. And again.

Just gotta keep trying and you‚Äôll eventually realize that ‚Äúoh wow. I‚Äôve gotten better at this.‚Äù

# Daily In-Progress Team Code Reviews. YES, in-progress AND with the team!

 <!--Mart√≠n P√©rez wrote up a fantastic article around how to expedite code reviews, by *scheduling* it as a daily routine, such that it becomes a habit.

{% link https://dev.to/mpermar/the-3pm-code-review-rule-2ppf %}

I :heart: code reviews and have implemented a **daily in-progress team code review** process for my dev team.


{% devcomment gdop %}-->



# Intro

Write this last.

# The How

What the in-progress team code review process looks like.

![Wait. Wut?](https://media.giphy.com/media/QjrrSbYaqgi1q/giphy.gif)

# The Why

I recently implemented a code review process for my team of 3 developers (5 total, with 2 offshore)

I joined a new team earlier this year as a Tech Lead. This team owns, supports and manages about 40 applications total, each of which is a complex piece on its own, and all of which I have *very* limited knowledge on.

As the weeks went by, I noticed that the application knowledge is *contained* only on those who have worked on it. 

# The When

Not to be used all the time, but it's a good tool to use when knowledge is siloed and team has either been just created or a member was added/removed.

# Wrap-Up

Summarize.

End with a quote around code reviews or team building?

# Why Code Reviews Are Great

Code reviews are absolutely necessary to not just in ensuring higher quality code, but to also build team knowledge, encourage team collaboration and thereby, building team trust.

Share knowledge with the entire team. Knowledge shared among all members of the team empowers the team members to help each other as needed. It also helps all members learn from each other in terms of patterns and code styles.

Keep review scope small. Code can change a LOT in just 1 day. So reviewing the code daily helps the team keep up with the context and the scope of the review is smaller than if you were to review a "ready" pull request.

Build team trust. Reviewing together and learning how to work with each other opens the door to increase team trust. High team trust = highly performant teams.

Code reviews are a great way to ensure code quality but I love to use them as a tool to build up and enable the team as well. üëç

# 5 Steps to Become a Web Developer
# 1. Understand Front-End vs Back-End

Web developers bring websites to life. A more complicated website would need a **front-end** and a **back-end**.

* **Front-end** typically deals with whatever the user sees on the website, and handles anything the user *does* on the site. Some examples are:
    * *Button clicks.* On YouTube, if the user clicks on the "hamburger" menu on the left, the left menu toggles between wide and narrow.
    * *Mouse hovers.* On YouTube, if a user's mouse hovers over a video thumbnail, it becomes animated to show a preview of the video.
* **Back-end** deals with information retrieval/storage and any logic that needs to be applied depending on the information that it handles. Some examples are:
    * *


# 2. Choose Your Track

Now that you understand what **front-end** vs **back-end** is, now you can choose a track of which one to focus on.

You could be:
1. **A front-end developer.** You would focus on the *client* side, as described above. 
1. **A back-end developer.** You would focus on the backend
1. **A full-stack developer.**

# 3. Choose Your Technologies




***If being a web developer does not interest you, you could become a mobile developer instead.*
