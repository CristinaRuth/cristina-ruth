# Skills You Need To Successfully Consult as a Dev

## Learning

Per Steve Perkins:

> An employee is expected to have some ramp-up time to absorb the stack, the company, the culture, etc, but a consultant is expected to be productive as quickly as possible. That means the entire engagement depends on the consultant learning as much as possible as fast as possible - understanding the client's business, their needs, their problems, how to get results from other people in the company, who to talk to for what, etc.

## Ability to Listen

Per Bo Monroe:

> You have to be able to listen very carefully hear to what your client is really asking for versus what he/she may be asking for at face value. ‚ÄúListening‚Äù encompasses asking good questions

## Expectation Management

So by Expectation Management, I mean that developers should be able to set expectations with customers and teammates, if applicable.
This means, letting them know what's coming next, what to expect, what are the good things, what are the bad things.


Wrong expectations would result in people getting upset because expectations weren't managed well enough.

For example, I am working with a customer and they asked me to develop something.


If I didn't manage expectations well, I would say I'll get this done within a week.

If I did, I could say that I need more information, and some time to research, and I don't know the exact timeline yet.

## Negotiation

Customers can tend to ask for impossible things. Having the ability to counter their asks and explain things in a way that they can see the benefit to them, can mean $$$ saved for the customers and more efficient solutions.

## Explain Technical Concepts

Having the ability to be able to explain technical concepts to people who don't understand them will set a consultant apart.

Think explaining CORS to a customer, and being able to explain it more with relatable common objects where non-technical people can relate. Or explaining technical debt.

Being able to do so will help convince customers of concepts you want them to do.

## Agnosticism

Per Bo Monroe

> It‚Äôs easy to get married to a favorite tech or toolchain, but it may not always be the best fit for your client. One size doesn‚Äôt always fit all..

** CHAT IMAGE HERE **

## Organization

Organization skills can help you keep track of all the things that need to be done  TODAY vs LATER.

It can help you keep notes of what was discussed with clients, past decisions and paths forward.


Knowing what can be done TODAY vs LATER will also help keep you focused and know when to set expectations and communicate with your client;


Being focused would mean efficiency in spending $$$ therefore reducing cost.

## Realism

Per Bo Monroe

>This maybe overlaps with several of the other ideas, inc. Expectation Management ‚Äî but this also might be one of the areas I‚Äôm personally worst at. For instance, building out realistic timelines ‚Äî I find I‚Äôm almost always way too optimistic, even after doing this kind of thing for a long time‚Ä¶

## Empathy

Per Steve Perkins:

> Really just a facet of client relations - understanding the client's motivations, situation, desires, limitations, etc from their perspective provides not only an alignment of purpose but also builds trust

## Business Understanding

We develop software for businesses!
The more we understand that business, their processes, their customers, and their needs, the better the solution we will end up creating for them.

** CHAT IMAGE HERE **

## Out-of-the-Box Thinking

Per Bo Monroe:
> sometimes the inspiration for an innovative approach to a problem comes from a completely different discipline or field

**CHAT IMAGE HERE**

## Documentation
Per Bo Monroe:
>a no-brainer, but often a place where freelancer‚Äôs esp cut corners ‚Äî after all, the client usually doesn‚Äôt care (at first!) if the code is well documented and organized

** CHAT IMAGE HERE **

## Stewardship

Per Steve Perkins:
>Consultants are responsible for spending the client's money wisely. There are lots of ways that can manifest, but it comes down to acting in the best interest of the client at all times - even if your employer wants you to do otherwise. A trust relationship is paramount in consulting, especially in a small town like Madison.

## Flexibility

While it's important to negotiate with clients on what's right, it's still important to be flexible if the negotiation doesn't work out.
Don't get too stuck on your opinions because ultimately, the customer being happy is what matters and if we remain stubborn, then customers will just get frustrated and we will NOT get anything done.

# Daily In-Progress Team Code Reviews. YES, in-progress AND with the team!

 <!--Mart√≠n P√©rez wrote up a fantastic article around how to expedite code reviews, by *scheduling* it as a daily routine, such that it becomes a habit.

{% link https://dev.to/mpermar/the-3pm-code-review-rule-2ppf %}

I :heart: code reviews and have implemented a **daily in-progress team code review** process for my dev team.


{% devcomment gdop %}-->



# Intro

Write this last.

# The How

What the in-progress team code review process looks like.

![Wait. Wut?](https://media.giphy.com/media/QjrrSbYaqgi1q/giphy.gif)

# The Why

I recently implemented a code review process for my team of 3 developers (5 total, with 2 offshore)

I joined a new team earlier this year as a Tech Lead. This team owns, supports and manages about 40 applications total, each of which is a complex piece on its own, and all of which I have *very* limited knowledge on.

As the weeks went by, I noticed that the application knowledge is *contained* only on those who have worked on it. 

# The When

Not to be used all the time, but it's a good tool to use when knowledge is siloed and team has either been just created or a member was added/removed.

![Go team!](https://media.giphy.com/media/3rgXBrLlRs4ZlpnVDO/giphy.gif)

# Wrap-Up

Summarize.

End with a quote around code reviews or team building?

# Why Code Reviews Are Great

Code reviews are absolutely necessary to not just in ensuring higher quality code, but to also build team knowledge, encourage team collaboration and thereby, building team trust.

Share knowledge with the entire team. Knowledge shared among all members of the team empowers the team members to help each other as needed. It also helps all members learn from each other in terms of patterns and code styles.

Keep review scope small. Code can change a LOT in just 1 day. So reviewing the code daily helps the team keep up with the context and the scope of the review is smaller than if you were to review a "ready" pull request.

Build team trust. Reviewing together and learning how to work with each other opens the door to increase team trust. High team trust = highly performant teams.

Code reviews are a great way to ensure code quality but I love to use them as a tool to build up and enable the team as well. üëç

# 5 Steps to Become a Web Developer
# 1. Understand Front-End vs Back-End

Web developers bring websites to life. A more complicated website would need a **front-end** and a **back-end**.

* **Front-end** typically deals with whatever the user sees on the website, and handles anything the user *does* on the site. Some examples are:
    * *Button clicks.* On YouTube, if the user clicks on the "hamburger" menu on the left, the left menu toggles between wide and narrow.
    * *Mouse hovers.* On YouTube, if a user's mouse hovers over a video thumbnail, it becomes animated to show a preview of the video.
* **Back-end** deals with information retrieval/storage and any logic that needs to be applied depending on the information that it handles. Some examples are:
    * *


# 2. Choose Your Track

Now that you understand what **front-end** vs **back-end** is, now you can choose a track of which one to focus on.

You could be:
1. **A front-end developer.** You would focus on the *client* side, as described above. 
1. **A back-end developer.** You would focus on the backend
1. **A full-stack developer.**

# 3. Choose Your Technologies




***If being a web developer does not interest you, you could become a mobile developer instead.*
