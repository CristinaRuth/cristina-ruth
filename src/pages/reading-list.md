## The 3-Minute Rule

As I've gone through my software development career, I've come to realize that we are a **lot** more effective as developers/engineers/architects when we can **sell** to people. Not products, but ideas and concepts, like convincing the organization to rewrite a system or application, or convincing your peers to go with a particular technology vs another.

This book sells the concept of "less is more" and provides a structure of how to pitch ideas in 3 minutes or less.

# Completed and Recommended

## 1. How to Win Friends and Influence People

This book helped me focus on others instead of myself, and oddly enough, by focusing on others, I have actually benefitted more by forming more genuine connections and had a huge part in earning me a promotion.

If you find yourself struggling to talk with people, give this book a shot and see what kind of learnings you can take from it.

## 2. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

I honestly thought this was a productivity book. Little did I know that it contained lots and lots of life lessons within. One of the biggest lessons I took from this book was:

> Seek first to understand, than to be understood.

This is huge when talking with people, especially conflicts, which is inevitable in any relationship, personal or professional.

This book enhanced the learnings I got from How to Win Friends and Influence People, and taught me more about relationships, both personal and professional, as well as teaching me how to determine what I really want and then take actions on those wants/goals.

If you'd like to further improve your relationships, as well as learn how to set your goals and take action, definitely read this book.

## 3. Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High

I found this book helpful on dealing with conflicts with people and being able to navigate those conversations especially with emotions run high. This is another book that can help you hone those people skills after the 2 mentioned above.

## 4. Measure What Matters

This book outlines a system to set and monitor goals - OKR.

* **O** - Objective
* **KR** - Key Results

I've found this really helpful in setting goals and **how** to achieve them, and I've used this concept both at work and for my personal goals.
