<p>I'm currently a Software Engineering Manager at CUNA Mutual Group in Madison, WI, where I manage 4 development teams to deliver software in the FinTech space. I've only started the role back in June 2021, so it's a learning process on how to be a good leader. Through my previous experience leading 1 team through similar work, I've grown to value trust, culture, enablement, empowerment and high-quality software.</p>
