Today's digital world has accounts everywhere. That means logins and passwords.

But systems get hacked, hackers get our login info and our accounts get compromised. And now, we got a problem.

![Problem](https://media.giphy.com/media/ZajGATIGCQFCE/giphy.gif)

So some solutions then pop up. 

![Yay](https://media.giphy.com/media/31lPv5L3aIvTi/giphy.gif)

Like Multi-Factor Authentication. So then, if someone gets a hold of your password, if you have this setup, you can stay _safe_. Er. Safe-_er_. If someone gets ahold of your "factor" (which is less likely), then you're in trouble again.

Or, the bajillion ways multiple websites require you to have various different letter, symbol, capitalized and lower-case letters to ensure a more secure password.

Or, the bajillion systems who require you to change your password every x days.

Or, the push for you to use different passwords for every single thing.

Which causes yet another issue because then, we have **so many** passwords, and we can't fit it all in our brain, so then we forget and we reset our passwords, and we have yet to **remember another one**. Which we will likely forget **again** anyway.

So now, we got the problem of too many passwords, so we get password management solutions to remember our passwords for us.

I mean, `login with x platform` makes things better and easier, but not all systems support it, and it usually also means my data is shared.

All of these solutions and problems seem to go back to **one thing**: passwords.

![Aha](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohs7Ps45sznsObPMc/giphy.gif)

So. Is there any password-alternative out there to be able to have access to an account? There _has_ to be some other thing? I tried a quick google and couldn't find _anything_.

Do **you** know of any alternative solutions? Please save us from this password struggle that has overrun our digital experience today! :sob:
