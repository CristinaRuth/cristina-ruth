As a developer consultant, you generally work with clients, majority of whom are not technical, to help deliver a software solution to their problems.

It's not always easy because technical skills alone would not result in a happy client, and I was curious what key skills you need to have to be a successful one. So I chatted with 2 other senior devs, Steve Perkins and Bo Monroe, and we discussed what we think these key skills are.

Below is a summary of our key points and our chat log behind each one.

## 1. Learning

>**Steve:** An employee is expected to have some ramp-up time to absorb the stack, the company, the culture, etc, but a consultant is expected to be productive as quickly as possible. That means the entire engagement depends on the consultant learning as much as possible as fast as possible -- understanding the client's business, their needs, their problems, how to get results from other people in the company, who to talk to for what, etc.

>**Cristina:** Ah so can this also mean **adaptability**?

>**Steve:** I think there's a lot of overlap there

>**Cristina:** Yeah, I think a positive attitude is also key here

>**Cristina:** There's a lot of things to tackle

>**Cristina:** Having an "I can do it" attitude will keep you resilient in all the things that need to be done.

>**Steve:** Definitely. It's also a great way to build exposure to a wide breadth of things. The "sure, I'll take that on" attitude keeps you relevant as technology and the business keep moving forward.

## 2. Ability to Listen

>**Bo:** You have to be able to listen very carefully hear to what your client is really asking for versus what he/she may be asking for at face value. "Listening" encompasses asking good questions.

>**Cristina:** Oh, yeah, reading between the lines!

>**Steve:** That's a good point. Clients usually assume you know all about their business and general things about their problem. Sometimes getting results means putting on the deerstalker hat.

>**Bo:** Example: we've learned the hard way that clients don't always really know what platform (!) they should really be targeting. We've built web apps that the client later decided should be mobile, and vice versa. More careful inquiry, poking and prodding at the early stages, versus, simply taking the ask at face value would have saved both of us time & $.

>**Cristina:** And also, the client needs to feel that they're actually heard right?

>**Cristina:** It's a careful line to listen between the lines and making the customer not feel like they're heard and just sensing arrogance from the consultant.

## 3. Expectation Management

>**Cristina:** So by Expectation Management, I mean that developers should be able to set expectations with customers and teammates, if applicable.
This means, letting them know what's coming next, what to expect, what are the good things, what are the bad things.

>**Cristina:** Wrong expectations would result in people getting upset because expectations weren't managed well enough.

>**Cristina:** For example, I am working with a customer and they asked me to develop something.

>**Cristina:** If I didn't manage expectations well, I would say I'll get this done within a week.

>**Cristina:** If I did, I could say that I need more information, and some time to research, and I don't know the exact timeline yet.

>**Steve:** I've found this to be crucial for building trust with the client

>**Bo:** Managing client expectations is hugely important, and not always easy.

>**Bo:** so — yeah, good one.

## 4. Negotiation

Customers can tend to ask for impossible things. Having the ability to counter their asks and explain things in a way that they can see the benefit to them, can mean $$$ saved for the customers and more efficient solutions.

## 5. Explain Technical Concepts

Having the ability to be able to explain technical concepts to people who don't understand them will set a consultant apart.

Think explaining CORS to a customer, and being able to explain it more with relatable common objects where non-technical people can relate. Or explaining technical debt.

Being able to do so will help convince customers of concepts you want them to do.

## 6. Agnosticism

Per Bo Monroe

> It’s easy to get married to a favorite tech or toolchain, but it may not always be the best fit for your client. One size doesn’t always fit all..

## 7. Organization

Organization skills can help you keep track of all the things that need to be done  TODAY vs LATER.

It can help you keep notes of what was discussed with clients, past decisions and paths forward.


Knowing what can be done TODAY vs LATER will also help keep you focused and know when to set expectations and communicate with your client;


Being focused would mean efficiency in spending $$$ therefore reducing cost.

## 8. Realism

Per Bo Monroe

>This maybe overlaps with several of the other ideas, inc. Expectation Management — but this also might be one of the areas I’m personally worst at. For instance, building out realistic timelines — I find I’m almost always way too optimistic, even after doing this kind of thing for a long time…

## 9. Empathy

Per Steve Perkins:

> Really just a facet of client relations - understanding the client's motivations, situation, desires, limitations, etc from their perspective provides not only an alignment of purpose but also builds trust

## 10. Business Understanding

We develop software for businesses!
The more we understand that business, their processes, their customers, and their needs, the better the solution we will end up creating for them.

## 11. Out-of-the-Box Thinking

Per Bo Monroe:
> sometimes the inspiration for an innovative approach to a problem comes from a completely different discipline or field

## 12. Documentation
Per Bo Monroe:
>a no-brainer, but often a place where freelancer’s esp cut corners — after all, the client usually doesn’t care (at first!) if the code is well documented and organized

## 13. Stewardship

Per Steve Perkins:
>Consultants are responsible for spending the client's money wisely. There are lots of ways that can manifest, but it comes down to acting in the best interest of the client at all times - even if your employer wants you to do otherwise. A trust relationship is paramount in consulting, especially in a small town like Madison.

## 14. Flexibility

While it's important to negotiate with clients on what's right, it's still important to be flexible if the negotiation doesn't work out.
Don't get too stuck on your opinions because ultimately, the customer being happy is what matters and if we remain stubborn, then customers will just get frustrated and we will NOT get anything done.
